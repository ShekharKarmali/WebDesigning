Database command:
to show:show databases;
to create databse:create database dbname
to use database: use dbname;
to check status:status;  
to show tables:show table
to show table: describe tablename;
to select table: select * from Tablename;
to insert into table: insert into tablename(field1,field2,field3,...)
values(value1,'value2(if string)',......);
to create table: create table tablename
                 (field datatype(size),...);
to delete table: drop table tablename
to update: update tablename
           set column_name=new value
           [,column_name=new value,....]
           Where condition;
to delete data from table: Deleting all row from the table

           Delecting selected row
to select:-
selected coloumn,all row:select coloumn from tablename
all coloumn,selected row:select * from tablename where condition
selected coloumn,selected rows:select coloumn from tablename where condition;
**During insert field and their corressponding value must be there.
to make changes into table :alter table tablename
                            then command for changes
Data constrain:
               1>NOT NULL(EX:modify id int(50) NOT NULL;
               2>UNIQUE constraint means value cannot be repeat except NULL
                 DIFF between unique and primary is primary cannot accept NULL
                 while unique can.One primary key per table constraint is possible 
                 except combining two coloumn.
                 add UNIQUE(tablename)
               3>Primary Key
                 No Duplicate
                 No NULL value posible
                 Syntax=Field PRIMARY kEY or PRIMARY KEY(field)
                or ALTER table tablename PRIMARY KEY(Field)
               4>Foreign Key
                 When there is one to many relation and Many to Many relation(create another mix table)
                 FOREIGN KEY in one table points to a PRIMARY KEY in another table
               5>DEFAULT KEY
                 TO set default value:Syntax
                 alter field SET DEFAULT 'value' OR
                 field datatype DEFAULT 'value'(During creating Table)
               6>Check Constraint
                 It is used to define range
                 Syntax:
                 At time of creating table use CHECK(condition) or
                 after table creation:ADD CHECK(condition)
AUTO_INCREMENT :It is used to generate unique id for new row
                It add one value to last value and increment its value
                Syntax:coloumn_name auto_increament.
TO Create User: create user 'username'@'localhost/servername' identified by 'password';
To Access other user databases: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.*(to all table)/table_name TO 'username'@'localhost'
                                ##Here instead of ALL we can specify particular PRIVILAGES lke
                                  select_privi
                                  insert_privi
                                  update_privi
